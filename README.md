## Modifying

This project uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). To modify the JavaScript
files, you'll need to first run the following commands:

```
npm install
npx webpack --config webpack.config.js
```

After that, webpack will watch the JavaScript files for any changes and
generate an updated ``bundle.js`` file.

## Credit

The heart icon started with the heart icon from [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome)
as a base. This modified heart icon was then used to create the spade icon as well.
